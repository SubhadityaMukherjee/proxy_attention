\section{Scientific Relevance for Artificial Intelligence} \label{section:relevance}
Training networks on new data is a fundamental task in AI. But for a majority of researchers and startups, the cost of this training is quite high. Also considering the lack of large amounts of data for specific use cases, a need to reduce the training time and require less data during training is ever present.\\
This research focuses on performing a more informed augmentation that hopes to reduce these problems and allow for faster training with lesser data. In the process, it attempts to use advances in field of XAI to improve training. Further, this project leads into the field of continual learning where adding new information is quite costly and presents a method to reduce this cost.\\
More specifically, this project aims to make the following contributions to the literature:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a new informed Augmentation method that uses saliency outputs as a sort of Proxy-Attention to improve performance
    \item Use advances in the field of XAI to empower networks directly
    \item Contrast using a ViT \cite{dosovitskiy2020image} with a Convnet + Proxy Attention
    \item Reduce training cost and time of networks so as to aid in continual learning
\end{itemize}
