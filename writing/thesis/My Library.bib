  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

Several saliency methods have been proposed, often guided by visual appeal on image data. In this work, we propose an actionable methodology to evaluate what kinds of explanations a given method can and cannot provide. We find that reliance, solely, on visual assessment can be misleading. Through extensive experiments we show that some existing saliency methods are independent both of the model and of the data generating process. Consequently, methods that fail the proposed tests are inadequate for tasks that are sensitive to either data or model, such as, finding outliers in the data, explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs that the model learned, and debugging the model. We interpret our findings through an analogy with edge detection in images, a technique that requires neither training data nor model. Theory in the case of a linear model and a single-layer convolutional neural network supports our experimental findings.},

Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer \textendash{} a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud's recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let's try to break the model apart and look at how it functions. The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard's NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter. 2020 Update: I've created a ``Narrated Transformer'' video which is a gentler approach to the topic: A High-Level Look Let's begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.},

In this work, we analyze four gradient-based attribution methods and formally prove conditions of equivalence and approximation between them. By reformulating two of these methods, we construct a unified framework which enables a direct comparison, as well as an easier implementation.

  abstract = {In the last years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of AI techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI. Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the existing literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is sought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This literature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to XAI with a reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

This work provides an assessment of these practical frameworks with the lens of known best practices for impact assessment and audit of technology. We review other historical uses of risk assessments and audits and create a typology that allows us to compare current AI ethics tools to Best Practices found in previous methodologies from technology, environment, privacy, finance and engineering. We analyse current AI ethics tools and their support for diverse stakeholders and components of the AI development and deployment lifecycle as well as the types of tools used to facilitate use. From this, we identify gaps in current AI ethics tools in auditing and risk assessment that should be considered going forward.},

  abstract = {The practical impact of deep learning on complex supervised learning problems has been significant, so much so that almost every Artificial Intelligence problem, or at least a portion thereof, has been somehow recast as a deep learning problem. The applications appeal is significant, but this appeal is increasingly challenged by what some call the challenge of explainability, or more generally the more traditional challenge of debuggability: if the outcomes of a deep learning process produce unexpected results (e.g., less than expected performance of a classifier), then there is little available in the way of theories or tools to help investigate the potential causes of such unexpected behavior, especially when this behavior could impact people's lives. We describe a preliminary framework to help address this issue, which we call "deep visual explanation" (DVE). "Deep," because it is the development and performance of deep neural network models that we want to understand. "Visual," because we believe that the most rapid insight into a complex multi-dimensional model is provided by appropriate visualization techniques, and "Explanation," because in the spectrum from instrumentation by inserting print statements to the abductive inference of explanatory hypotheses, we believe that the key to understanding deep learning relies on the identification and exposure of hypotheses about the performance behavior of a learned deep model. In the exposition of our preliminary framework, we use relatively straightforward image classification examples and a variety of choices on initial configuration of a deep model building scenario. By careful but not complicated instrumentation, we expose classification outcomes of deep models using visualization, and also show initial results for one potential application of interpretability.},

Given any CNN model, the proposed method draws on a broad data set of visual concepts to score the semantics of hidden units at each intermediate convolutional layer. The units with semantics are given labels across a range of objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed method to test the hypothesis that interpretability of units is equivalent to random linear combinations of units, then we apply our method to compare the latent representations of various networks when trained to solve different supervised and self-supervised training tasks. We further analyze the effect of training iterations, compare networks trained with different initializations, examine the impact of network depth and width, and measure the effect of dropout and batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shed light on characteristics of CNN models and training methods that go beyond measurements of their discriminative power.},

  abstract = {Convolutional networks have been the paradigm of choice in many computer vision applications. The convolution operation however has a significant weakness in that it only operates on a local neighborhood, thus missing global information. Self-attention, on the other hand, has emerged as a recent advance to capture long range interactions, but has mostly been applied to sequence modeling and generative modeling tasks. In this paper, we consider the use of self-attention for discriminative visual tasks as an alternative to convolutions. We introduce a novel two-dimensional relative self-attention mechanism that proves competitive in replacing convolutions as a stand-alone computational primitive for image classification. We find in control experiments that the best results are obtained when combining both convolutions and self-attention. We therefore propose to augment convolutional operators with this self-attention mechanism by concatenating convolutional feature maps with a set of feature maps produced via self-attention. Extensive experiments show that Attention Augmentation leads to consistent improvements in image classification on ImageNet and object detection on COCO across many different models and scales, including ResNets and a stateof-the art mobile constrained network, while keeping the number of parameters similar. In particular, our method achieves a 1.3\% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet classification over a ResNet50 baseline and outperforms other attention mechanisms for images such as Squeezeand-Excitation [17]. It also achieves an improvement of 1.4 mAP in COCO Object Detection on top of a RetinaNet baseline.},

We then use the census to help hand-curate a look-up-table of images in the ImageNet-ILSVRC-2012 dataset that fall into the categories of verifiably pornographic: shot in a non-consensual setting (up-skirt), beach voyeuristic, and exposed private parts. We survey the landscape of harm and threats both the society at large and individuals face due to uncritical and ill-considered dataset curation practices. We then propose possible courses of correction and critique their pros and cons. We have duly open-sourced all of the code and the census meta-datasets generated in this endeavor for the computer vision community to build on. By unveiling the severity of the threats, our hope is to motivate the constitution of mandatory Institutional Review Boards (IRB) for large scale dataset curation.},

This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

Eleven of these measures have not been reviewed in previous surveys. Three out of the five short-listed best viewpoint measures are directly related to information.

  abstract = {The cognitive architecture ACT-R is at the same time a psychological theory and a modeling framework for constructing cognitive models that adhere to the principles of the theory. ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI data in two different ways: (1) fMRI data can be used to evaluate and constrain models in ACT-R by means of predefined Region-of-Interest (ROI) analysis, and (2) predictions from ACT-R models can be used to locate neural correlates of model processes and representations by means of modelbased fMRI analysis. In this paper we provide a step-by-step tutorial on both approaches. Note that this tutorial neither teaches the ACT-R theory in any detail, nor fMRI analysis, but explains how ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI data. To this end, we provide all data and computer code necessary to run the ACT-R model, carry out the analyses, and recreate the figures in the paper. As an example dataset we use a relatively simple algebra task. In the first section, we develop an ACT-R model of this task and fit it to behavioral data. In the second section, we apply a predefined ROI-analysis to evaluate the model using fMRI data. In the third section, we use model-based fMRI analysis to locate the following processes in the brain: retrieval of mathematical facts from memory, working memory updates, motor responses, and visually encoding the problems. After working through this tutorial, the reader will have learned what can be achieved with the two different analysis methods and how they are conducted; the example code can then be adapted to a new dataset.},

Results reveal that, like adults, preschoolers (a) recognize that generics have flexible truth conditions and are capable of representing a wide range of prevalence levels; and (b) interpret novel generics as having near-universal prevalence implications. Results further show that by age 4, children are beginning to differentiate the meaning of generics and quantified statements; however, even 7- to 11-year-olds are not adultlike in their intuitions about the meaning of most-quantified statements. Overall, these studies suggest that by preschool, children interpret generics in much the same way that adults do; however, mastery of the semantics of quantified statements follows a more protracted course.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has had tremendous success at learning low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. This success would be impossible if there was no hidden low-dimensional structure in data of interest; this existence is posited by the manifold hypothesis, which states that the data lies on an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension. In this paper, we argue that this hypothesis does not properly capture the low-dimensional structure typically present in data. Assuming the data lies on a single manifold implies intrinsic dimension is identical across the entire data space, and does not allow for subregions of this space to have a different number of factors of variation. To address this deficiency, we put forth the union of manifolds hypothesis, which accommodates the existence of non-constant intrinsic dimensions. We empirically verify this hypothesis on commonly-used image datasets, finding that indeed, intrinsic dimension should be allowed to vary. We also show that classes with higher intrinsic dimensions are harder to classify, and how this insight can be used to improve classification accuracy. We then turn our attention to the impact of this hypothesis in the context of deep generative models (DGMs). Most current DGMs struggle to model datasets with several connected components and/or varying intrinsic dimensions. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose clustered DGMs, where we first cluster the data and then train a DGM on each cluster. We show that clustered DGMs can model multiple connected components with different intrinsic dimensions, and empirically outperform their non-clustered counterparts without increasing computational requirements.},

As a black box model due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, Deep Neural Networks are often criticized as being non-transparent and their predictions not traceable by humans. Furthermore, the models learn from artificially generated datasets, which often do not reflect reality. By basing decision-making algorithms on Deep Neural Networks, prejudice and unfairness may be promoted unknowingly due to a lack of transparency. Hence, several so-called explanators, or explainers, have been developed. Explainers try to give insight into the inner structure of machine learning black boxes by analyzing the connection between the input and output. In this survey, we present the mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks. We give a comprehensive overview about the taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize further research ideas.},

Algorithms for this task are based on the idea that the dimensionality of many data sets is only artificially high; though each data point consists of perhaps thousands of features, it may be described as a function of only a few underlying parameters. That is, the data points are actually samples from a low-dimensional manifold that is embedded in a high-dimensional space. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to uncover these parameters in order to find a low-dimensional representation of the data. In this paper, we discuss the motivation, background, and algorithms proposed for manifold learning.

The drawback of this method is that it cannot be used to generalize CNN behaviour. In this paper, we present a novel method that extends Grad-CAM from example-based explanations to a method for explaining global model behaviour. This is achieved by introducing two new metrics, (i) Mean Observed Dissimilarity (MOD) and (ii) Variation in Dissimilarity (VID), for model generalization. These metrics are computed by comparing a Normalized Inverted Structural Similarity Index (NISSIM) metric of the Grad-CAM generated heatmap for samples from the original test set and samples from the adversarial test set. For our experiment, we study adversarial attacks on deep models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101, and wide models such as InceptionNetv3 and XceptionNet using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). We then compute the metrics MOD and VID for the automatic face recognition (AFR) use case with the VGGFace2 dataset. We observe a consistent shift in the region highlighted in the Grad-CAM heatmap, reflecting its participation to the decision making, across all models under adversarial attacks. The proposed method can be used to understand adversarial attacks and explain the behaviour of black box CNN models for image analysis.},

However, the unclear model decisions (i.e., black-box) undermine the credibility of the results and hinder their practicality. This study intends to obtain explanations of such models through the use of explainable artificial intelligence methods, and then use feature unlearning methods to improve their performance, which is the first such attempt in the field of forestry. Results of three experiments show that the model training can be guided by expertise to gain specific knowledge, which is reflected by explanations. For all three experiments based on synthetic and real leaf images, the improvement of models is quantified in the classification accuracy (up to 4.6\%) and three indicators of explanation assessment (i.e., root-mean-square error, cosine similarity, and the proportion of important pixels). Besides, the introduced expertise in annotation matrix form was automatically created in all experiments. This study emphasizes that studies of deep learning in forestry should not only pursue model performance (e.g., higher classification accuracy) but also focus on the explanations and try to improve models according to the expertise.},

  abstract = {This work investigates a simple yet powerful adapter for Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike recent visual transformers that introduce vision-specific inductive biases into their architectures, ViT achieves inferior performance on dense prediction tasks due to lacking prior information of images. To solve this issue, we propose a Vision Transformer Adapter (ViT-Adapter), which can remedy the defects of ViT and achieve comparable performance to vision-specific models by introducing inductive biases via an additional architecture. Specifically, the backbone in our framework is a vanilla transformer that can be pre-trained with multi-modal data. When fine-tuning on downstream tasks, a modality-specific adapter is used to introduce the data and tasks' prior information into the model, making it suitable for these tasks. We verify the effectiveness of our ViT-Adapter on multiple downstream tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, when using HTC++, our ViT-Adapter-L yields 60.1 box AP and 52.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev, surpassing Swin-L by 1.4 box AP and 1.0 mask AP. For semantic segmentation, our ViT-Adapter-L establishes a new state-of-the-art of 60.5 mIoU on ADE20K val, 0.6 points higher than SwinV2-G. We hope that the proposed ViT-Adapter could serve as an alternative for vision-specific transformers and facilitate future research.

The original Capsule relies on the existence of a spatial relationship between the elements in the feature map it is presented with, whereas in point permutation invariant formulations of 3D point set classification methods, such relationships are typically lost. Here, a new layer called ComposeCaps is introduced that, in lieu of a spatially relevant feature mapping, learns a new mapping that can be exploited by the 3DCapsule. Previous works in the 3D point set classification domain have focused on other parts of the architecture, whereas instead, the 3DCapsule is a drop-in replacement of the commonly used fully connected classifier. It is demonstrated via an ablation study, that when the 3DCapsule is applied to recent 3D point set classification architectures, it consistently shows an improvement, in particular when subjected to noisy data. Similarly, the ComposeCaps layer is evaluated and demonstrates an improvement over the baseline. In an apples-to-apples comparison against state-ofthe-art methods, again, better performance is demonstrated by the 3DCapsule.},

The estimated intrinsic dimension corresponds to the number of disentangled local perturbations. In this perspective, we analyze the intermediate layers of the mapping network in StyleGANs. Our analysis clarifies the success of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{W\}\$-space in StyleGAN and suggests an alternative. Moreover, the intrinsic dimension estimation opens the possibility of unsupervised evaluation of global-basis-compatibility and disentanglement for a latent space. Our proposed metric, called Distortion, measures an inconsistency of intrinsic tangent space on the learned latent space. The metric is purely geometric and does not require any additional attribute information. Nevertheless, the metric shows a high correlation with the global-basis-compatibility and supervised disentanglement score. Our findings pave the way towards an unsupervised selection of globally disentangled latent space among the intermediate latent spaces in a GAN.},

  abstract = {We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

Changes in the object representation along a hierarchical sensory system are associated with changes in the geometry of those manifolds, and recent theoretical progress connects this geometry with `classification capacity', a quantitative measure of the ability to support object classification. Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds' radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.},

The core of our solution is a convolutional long short-term memory that focuses on the most salient regions of the input image to iteratively refine the predicted saliency map. In addition, to tackle the center bias typical of human eye fixations, our model can learn a set of prior maps generated with Gaussian functions. We show, through an extensive evaluation, that the proposed architecture outperforms the current state-of-the-art on public saliency prediction datasets. We further study the contribution of each key component to demonstrate their robustness on different scenarios.},

An obstacle to a large-scale adoption of these methods is that they require a separate and expensive search phase. A common way to overcome the expense of the search phase was to use a smaller proxy task. However, it was not clear if the optimized hyperparameters found on the proxy task are also optimal for the actual task. In this work, we rethink the process of designing automated augmentation strategies. We find that while previous work required a search for both magnitude and probability of each operation independently, it is sufficient to only search for a single distortion magnitude that jointly controls all operations. We hence propose a simplified search space that vastly reduces the computational expense of automated augmentation, and permits the removal of a separate proxy task.},

Growing evidence suggests that Internet-related addictions are also associated with breakdown of functional brain networks. Taking into consideration the limited number of studies used in previous studies in Internet addiction (IA), our aim was to investigate the functional correlates of IA in the default mode network (DMN) and in the inhibitory control network (ICN). To observe these relationships, task-related fMRI responses to verbal Stroop and non-verbal Stroop-like tasks were measured in 60 healthy university students. The Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire (PIUQ) was used to assess IA. We found significant deactivations in areas related to the DMN (precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus) and these areas were negatively correlated with PIUQ during incongruent stimuli. In Stroop task the incongruent\_minus\_congruent contrast showed positive correlation with PIUQ in areas related to the ICN (left inferior frontal gyrus, left frontal pole, left central opercular, left frontal opercular, left frontal orbital and left insular cortex). Altered DMN might explain some comorbid symptoms and might predict treatment outcomes, while altered ICN may be the reason for having difficulties in stopping and controlling overuse.},

Typical effects of ToT are decreasing levels of task-related motivation and the deterioration of cognitive performance. However, a massive body of research indicates that the detrimental effects can be reversed by extrinsic motivators, for example, providing rewards to fatigued participants. Although several attempts have been made to identify brain areas involved in mental fatigue and related reward processing, the neural correlates are still less understood. In this study, we used the psychomotor vigilance task to induce mental fatigue and blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of the ToT effect and the reward effect (i.e., providing extra monetary reward after fatigue induction) in a healthy young sample. Our results were interpreted in a recently proposed neurocognitive framework. The activation of the right middle frontal gyrus, right insula and right anterior cingulate gyrus decreased as fatigue emerged and the cognitive performance dropped. However, after providing an extra reward, the cognitive performance, as well as activation of these areas, increased. Moreover, the activation levels of all of the mentioned areas were negatively associated with reaction times. Our results confirm that the middle frontal gyrus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex play crucial roles in cost-benefit evaluations, a potential background mechanism underlying fatigue, as suggested by the neurocognitive framework.},

However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks challenges its use in mission critical applications, raising ethical and judicial concerns inducing lack of trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that promotes a set of tools, techniques, and algorithms that can generate high-quality interpretable, intuitive, human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. In addition to providing a holistic view of the current XAI landscape in deep learning, this paper provides mathematical summaries of seminal work. We start by proposing a taxonomy and categorizing the XAI techniques based on their scope of explanations, methodology behind the algorithms, and explanation level or usage which helps build trustworthy, interpretable, and self-explanatory deep learning models. We then describe the main principles used in XAI research and present the historical timeline for landmark studies in XAI from 2007 to 2020. After explaining each category of algorithms and approaches in detail, we then evaluate the explanation maps generated by eight XAI algorithms on image data, discuss the limitations of this approach, and provide potential future directions to improve XAI evaluation.},

Despite its significant impact, there has not been a comprehensive investigation into the demographic attributes of images contained within the dataset. Such a study could lead to new insights on inherent biases within ImageNet, particularly important given it is frequently used to pretrain models for a wide variety of computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce a model-driven framework for the automatic annotation of apparent age and gender attributes in large-scale image datasets. Using this framework, we conduct the first demographic audit of the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) subset of ImageNet and the "person" hierarchical category of ImageNet. We find that 41.62\% of faces in ILSVRC appear as female, 1.71\% appear as individuals above the age of 60, and males aged 15 to 29 account for the largest subgroup with 27.11\%. We note that the presented model-driven framework is not fair for all intersectional groups, so annotation are subject to bias. We present this work as the starting point for future development of unbiased annotation models and for the study of downstream effects of imbalances in the demographics of ImageNet.

In this work, we consider object detection, semantic and instance segmentation and augment the training images by blending objects in existing scenes, using instance segmentation annotations. We observe that randomly pasting objects on images hurts the performance, unless the object is placed in the right context. To resolve this issue, we propose an explicit context model by using a convolutional neural network, which predicts whether an image region is suitable for placing a given object or not. In our experiments, we show that our approach is able to improve object detection, semantic and instance segmentation on the PASCAL VOC12 and COCO datasets, with significant gains in a limited annotation scenario, i.e. when only one category is annotated. We also show that the method is not limited to datasets that come with expensive pixel-wise instance annotations and can be used when only bounding boxes are available, by employing weakly-supervised learning for instance masks approximation.},

  abstract = {This paper calls attention to a methodological problem of acquisition experiments. It shows that the economy of the stimulus employed in child language experiments may lend an increased ostensive effect to the message communicated to the child. Thus, when the visual stimulus in a sentence-picture matching task is a minimal model abstracting away from the details of the situation, children often regard all the elements of the stimulus as ostensive clues to be represented in the corresponding sentence. The use of such minimal stimuli is mistaken when the experiment aims to test whether or not a certain element of the stimulus is relevant for the linguistic representation or interpretation. The paper illustrates this point by an experiment involving quantifier spreading. It is claimed that children find a universally quantified sentence like Every girl is riding a bicycle to be a false description of a picture showing three girls riding bicycles and a solo bicycle because they are misled to believe that all the elements in the visual stimulus are relevant, hence all of them are to be represented by the corresponding linguistic description. When the iconic drawings were replaced by photos taken in a natural environment rich in accidental details, the occurrence of quantifier spreading was radically reduced. It is shown that an extra object in the visual stimulus can lead to the rejection of the sentence also in the case of sentences involving no quantification, which gives further support to the claim that the source of the problem is not (or not only) the grammatical or cognitive difficulty of quantification but the unintended ostensive effect of the extra object.~~This article is part of the special collection: Acquisition of Quantification~A correction article related to this research can be found here:~http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.902},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural nets (CNN) are the leading computer vision method for classifying images. In some cases, it is desirable to classify only a specific region of the image that corresponds to a certain object. Hence, assuming that the region of the object in the image is known in advance and is given as a binary region of interest (ROI) mask, the goal is to classify the object in this region using a convolutional neural net. This goal is achieved using a standard image classification net with the addition of a side branch, which converts the ROI mask into an attention map. This map is then combined with the image classification net. This allows the net to focus the attention on the object region while still extracting contextual cues from the background. This approach was evaluated using the COCO object dataset and the OpenSurfaces materials dataset. In both cases, it gave superior results to methods that completely ignore the background region. In addition, it was found that combining the attention map at the first layer of the net gave better results than combining it at higher layers of the net. The advantages of this method are most apparent in the classification of small regions which demands a great deal of contextual information from the background.},

In this paper, we propose a new automatic and adaptive algorithm for choosing the transformations of the samples used in data augmentation. Specifically, for each sample, our main idea is to seek a small transformation that yields maximal classification loss on the transformed sample. We employ a trust-region optimization strategy, which consists of solving a sequence of linear programs. Our data augmentation scheme is then integrated into a Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm for training deep neural networks. We perform experiments on two datasets, and show that that the proposed scheme outperforms random data augmentation algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness, while yielding comparable or superior results with respect to existing selective sampling approaches.},

An important family of attribution methods is based on measuring the effect of perturbations applied to the input. In this paper, we discuss some of the shortcomings of existing approaches to perturbation analysis and address them by introducing the concept of extremal perturbations, which are theoretically grounded and interpretable. We also introduce a number of technical innovations to compute extremal perturbations, including a new area constraint and a parametric family of smooth perturbations, which allow us to remove all tunable hyper-parameters from the optimization problem. We analyze the effect of perturbations as a function of their area, demonstrating excellent sensitivity to the spatial properties of the deep neural network under stimulation. We also extend perturbation analysis to the intermediate layers of a network. This application allows us to identify the salient channels necessary for classification, which, when visualized using feature inversion, can be used to elucidate model behavior. Lastly, we introduce TorchRay, an interpretability library built on PyTorch.},

The resulting feature vectors are then concatenated to support the final classification. We show that HVE can summarize and rank-order the contributions of the three features to object recognition. We use human experiments to confirm that both HVE and humans predominantly use some specific features to support the classification of specific classes (e.g., texture is the dominant feature to distinguish a zebra from other quadrupeds, both for humans and HVE). With the help of HVE, given any environment (dataset), we can summarize the most important features for the whole task (task-specific; e.g., color is the most important feature overall for classification with the CUB dataset), and for each class (class-specific; e.g., shape is the most important feature to recognize boats in the iLab-20M dataset). To demonstrate more usefulness of HVE, we use it to simulate the open-world zero-shot learning ability of humans with no attribute labeling. Finally, we show that HVE can also simulate human imagination ability with the combination of different features. We will open-source the HVE engine and corresponding datasets.},

Some recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation instead when trained on "Stylized-ImageNet", a stylized version of ImageNet. This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560 psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions, highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.},

  abstract = {In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions. For example, if an algorithm classifies a given pathology image to be a malignant tumor, then the doctor may need to know which parts of the image led the algorithm to this classification. How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of research. A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions is extremely fragile in the following sense: two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different interpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, relevance propagation, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation approaches.},

We employed a simple action video game called Auto Orbit and investigated the control tuning of timing skills across speed perturbations of the environment. In Auto Orbit, players needed to learn to alternate turn and shot actions to blow and burst balloons under time constraints imposed by balloon resets and deflations. Cognitive and motor skill transfer was assessed both in terms of game performance and in terms of the details of their motor actions. We found that skill transfer across speeds necessitated the recalibration of action timing skills. In addition, we found that acquiring skill in Auto Orbit involved a progressive decrease in variability of behavior. Finally, we found that players with higher skill levels tended to be less variable in terms of action chunking and action timing. These findings further shed light on the complex cognitive and motor mechanisms of skill transfer across speeds in complex task environments.},

  abstract = {There has recently been a surge of work in explanatory artificial intelligence (XAI). This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we provide our definition of explainability and show how it can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {In visual recognition problems, the common data distribution mismatches between training and testing make domain adaptation essential. However, image data is difficult to manually divide into the discrete domains required by adaptation algorithms, and the standard practice of equating datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways (lighting, pose, background, resolution, etc.) We propose an approach to automatically discover latent domains in image or video datasets. Our formulation imposes two key properties on domains: maximum distinctiveness and maximum learnability. By maximum distinctiveness, we require the underlying distributions of the identified domains to be different from each other; by maximum learnability, we ensure that a strong discriminative model can be learned from the domain. We devise a nonparametric representation and efficient optimization procedure for distinctiveness, which, when coupled with our learnability constraint, can successfully discover domains among both training and test data. We extensively evaluate our approach on object recognition and human activity recognition tasks.},

(2020) proposed that repetition of any element in the previous trial triggers the retrieval of other elements in the same event file. Consistent with this framework, Los et al. (2014) argued that the temporal relation between the warning signal and the target stimulus on a trial is stored in a distinct memory trace (or, event file). Retrieval of the preceding memory trace, which is triggered by perceiving the same warning signal, leads to sequential foreperiod (SFP) effect. We modeled the data from four experiments using a Bayesian method to investigate whether the SFP effect changes over time. Results of Experiments 1, 3 and 4 support the multiple trace theory of preparation, which predicts an asymmetric sequential foreperiod effect, whereas those of Experiment 2 (extremely short foreperiods) support the repetition priming account by Capizzi et al. (2015). Moreover, the significance of the parameters showed that the asymmetry in Experiments 1 and 3 (non-aging distribution) developed gradually, whereas in Experiment 4 (uniform distribution), this asymmetry was significant from the beginning and did not change over time. Implications of these findings for temporal preparation models and BRAC framework were discussed.},

  abstract = {A warning signal preceding an imperative stimulus by a certain foreperiod can accelerate responses (foreperiod effect). When foreperiod is varied within a block, the foreperiod effect on reaction time (RT) is modulated by both the current and the prior foreperiods. Using a non-aging foreperiod distribution in a simple-reaction task, Capizzi et al. (Cognition, 134, 39-49, 2015) found equal sequential effects for different foreperiods, which they credited to repetition priming. The multiple-trace theory of Los et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 5, Article 1058, 2014) attributes the slope of the foreperiod-RT function to the foreperiod distribution. We conducted three experiments that examined these predicted relations. Experiment 1 tested Capizzi et al.'s prediction in a choice-reaction task and found an increasing foreperiod-RT function but a larger sequential effect at the shorter foreperiod. Experiment 2 used two distinct short foreperiods with the same foreperiod distribution and found a decreasing foreperiod-RT function. By increasing the difference between the foreperiods used in Experiment 2, Experiment 3 yielded a larger sequential effect overall. The experiments provide evidence that, with a non-aging foreperiod distribution, the variable-foreperiod paradigm yields unequal sequential-effect sizes at the different foreperiods, consistent with the multiple-trace theory but contrary to Capizzi et al.'s repetition-priming account. The foreperiod-RT functions are similar to those of the fixed-foreperiod paradigm, which is not predicted by the multiple trace theory.},

We will show that, by combining these refinements together, we are able to improve various CNN models significantly. For example, we raise ResNet-50's top-1 validation accuracy from 75.3\% to 79.29\% on ImageNet. We will also demonstrate that improvement on image classification accuracy leads to better transfer learning performance in other application domains such as object detection and semantic segmentation.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators [1] have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used in decision-making tasks. However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed from millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design. The Summit visualization runs in modern web browsers and is open-sourced.},

In this paper, a dynamic visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure the perspective entropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features according to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison to mainstream approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of return.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models have a large number of free parameters that need to be calculated by effective training of the models on a great deal of training data to improve their generalization performance. However, data obtaining and labeling is expensive in practice. Data augmentation is one of the methods to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary study on how three variables (augmentation method, augmentation rate and size of basic dataset per label) can affect the accuracy of deep learning for image classification. The study provides some guidelines: (1) it is better to use transformations that alter the geometry of the images rather than those just lighting and color. (2) 2-3 times augmentation rate is good enough for training. (3) the smaller amount of data, the more obvious contributions could have.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning has seen an unprecedented increase in vision applications since the publication of large-scale object recognition datasets and introduction of scalable compute hardware. State-of-the-art methods for most vision tasks for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on supervised learning and often fail to generalize to domain shifts and/or outliers. Dataset diversity is thus key to successful real-world deployment. No matter how big the size of the dataset, capturing long tails of the distribution pertaining to task-specific environmental factors is impractical. The goal of this paper is to investigate the use of targeted synthetic data augmentation - combining the benefits of gaming engine simulations and sim2real style transfer techniques - for filling gaps in real datasets for vision tasks. Empirical studies on three different computer vision tasks of practical use to AVs parking slot detection, lane detection and monocular depth estimation - consistently show that having synthetic data in the training mix provides a significant boost in cross-dataset generalization performance as compared to training on real data only, for the same size of the training set.},

  abstract = {3D shape retrieval has attracted much attention and become a hot topic in computer vision field recently.With the development of deep learning, 3D shape retrieval has also made great progress and many view-based methods have been introduced in recent years. However, how to represent 3D shapes better is still a challenging problem. At the same time, the intrinsic hierarchical associations among views still have not been well utilized. In order to tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a multi-loop-view convolutional neural network (MLVCNN) framework for 3D shape retrieval. In this method, multiple groups of views are extracted from different loop directions first. Given these multiple loop views, the proposed MLVCNN framework introduces a hierarchical view-loop-shape architecture, i.e., the view level, the loop level, and the shape level, to conduct 3D shape representation from different scales. In the view-level, a convolutional neural network is first trained to extract view features. Then, the proposed Loop Normalization and LSTM are utilized for each loop of view to generate the loop-level features, which considering the intrinsic associations of the different views in the same loop. Finally, all the loop-level descriptors are combined into a shape-level descriptor for 3D shape representation, which is used for 3D shape retrieval. Our proposed method has been evaluated on the public 3D shape benchmark, i.e., ModelNet40. Experiments and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed MLVCNN method can achieve significant performance improvement on 3D shape retrieval tasks. Our MLVCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by the mAP of 4.84\% in 3D shape retrieval task. We have also evaluated the performance of the proposed method on the 3D shape classification task where MLVCNN also achieves superior performance compared with recent methods.},

They have been shown to be successful in image classification models, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given parameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the number of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets family of architectures). Recently, convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks have been applied to machine translation tasks with good results. In this work, we study how depthwise separable convolutions can be applied to neural machine translation. We introduce a new architecture inspired by Xception and ByteNet, called SliceNet, which enables a significant reduction of the parameter count and amount of computation needed to obtain results like ByteNet, and, with a similar parameter count, achieves new state-of-the-art results. In addition to showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine translation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a new "super-separable" convolution operation that further reduces the number of parameters and computational cost for obtaining state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model ``RotationNet,'' which takes multi-view images of an object as input and jointly estimates its pose and object category. Unlike previous approaches that use known viewpoint labels for training, our method treats the viewpoint labels as latent variables, which are learned in an unsupervised manner during the training using an unaligned object dataset. RotationNet uses only a partial set of multi-view images for inference, and this property makes it useful in practical scenarios where only partial views are available. Moreover, our pose alignment strategy enables one to obtain view-specific feature representations shared across classes, which is important to maintain high accuracy in both object categorization and pose estimation. Effectiveness of RotationNet is demonstrated by its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods of 3D object classification on 10- and 40-class ModelNet datasets. We also show that RotationNet, even trained without known poses, achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on an object pose estimation dataset. Furthermore, our object ranking method based on classification by RotationNet achieved the first prize in two tracks of the 3D Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) 2017. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of real-world applications of RotationNet trained with our newly created multi-view image dataset using a moving USB camera.},

Most studies have tried to identify input pixels that are crucial to the prediction of a classifier. While this approach is meaningful to analyse the characteristic of blackbox models, it is also important to investigate pixels that interfere with the prediction. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an explanation method that visualizes undesirable regions to classify an image as a target class. To be specific, we divide the concept of undesirable regions into two terms: (1) factors for a target class, which hinder that black-box models identify intrinsic characteristics of a target class and (2) factors for non-target classes that are important regions for an image to be classified as other classes. We visualize such undesirable regions on heatmaps to qualitatively validate the proposed method. Furthermore, we present an evaluation metric to provide quantitative results on ImageNet.},

In this work, we present OrthographicNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model, for 3D object recognition in open-ended domains. In particular, OrthographicNet generates a global rotation- and scale-invariant representation for a given 3D object, enabling robots to recognize the same or similar objects seen from different perspectives. Experimental results show that our approach yields significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches concerning object recognition performance and scalability in open-ended scenarios. Moreover, OrthographicNet demonstrates the capability of learning new categories from very few examples on-site. Regarding real-time performance, three real-world demonstrations validate the promising performance of the proposed architecture.},

However, the exact nature of the relation between CNV and the underlying timing mechanisms is still a topic of discussion. On the one hand, it has been proposed that the CNV measured at supplementary motor area (SMA) is a direct reflection of the unfolding of time since a perceived onset, whereas other work has suggested that the increased amplitude reflects decision processes involved in interval timing. Strong evidence for the first view has been reported by Macar et al. (1999), who showed that variations in temporal performance were reflected in the measured CNV amplitude. If the CNV measured at SMA is a direct function of the passing of time, habituation effects are not expected. Here we report two replication studies, which both failed to replicate the expected performance-dependent variations. Even more powerful linear-mixed effect analyses failed to find any performance related effects on the CNV amplitude, whereas habituation effects were found. These studies therefore suggest that the CNV amplitude does not directly reflect the unfolding of time.},

  abstract = {There is growing appreciation for the role of long-term memory in guiding temporal preparation in speeded reaction time tasks. In experiments with variable foreperiods between a warning stimulus (S1) and a target stimulus (S2), preparation is affected by foreperiod distributions experienced in the past, long after the distribution has changed. These effects from memory can shape preparation largely implicitly, outside of participants' awareness. Recent studies have demonstrated the associative nature of memory-guided preparation. When distinct S1s predict different foreperiods, they can trigger differential preparation accordingly. Here, we propose that memory-guided preparation allows for another key feature of learning: the ability to generalize across acquired associations and apply them to novel situations. Participants completed a variable foreperiod task where S1 was a unique image of either a face or a scene on each trial. Images of either category were paired with different distributions with predominantly shorter versus predominantly longer foreperiods. Participants displayed differential preparation to never-before seen images of either category, without being aware of the predictive nature of these categories. They continued doing so in a subsequent Transfer phase, after they had been informed that these contingencies no longer held. A novel rolling regression analysis revealed at a fine timescale how category-guided preparation gradually developed throughout the task, and that explicit information about these contingencies only briefly disrupted memory-guided preparation. These results offer new insights into temporal preparation as the product of a largely implicit process governed by associative learning from past experiences.},

  abstract = {Traditional 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive, memory intensive, prone to overfit, and most importantly, there is a need to improve their feature learning capabilities. To address these issues, we propose Rectified Local Phase Volume (ReLPV) block, an efficient alternative to the standard 3D convolutional layer. The ReLPV block extracts the phase in a 3D local neighborhood (e.g., 3 \texttimes{} 3 \texttimes{} 3) of each position of the input map to obtain the feature maps. The phase is extracted by computing 3D Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT) at multiple fixed low frequency points in the 3D local neighborhood of each position. These feature maps at different frequency points are then linearly combined after passing them through an activation function. The ReLPV block provides significant parameter savings of at least, 33 to 133 times compared to the standard 3D convolutional layer with the filter sizes 3 \texttimes{} 3 \texttimes{} 3 to 13 \texttimes{} 13 \texttimes{} 13, respectively. We show that the feature learning capabilities of the ReLPV block are significantly better than the standard 3D convolutional layer. Furthermore, it produces consistently better results across different 3D data representations. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the volumetric ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 datasets while utilizing only 11\% parameters of the current state-of-theart. We also improve the state-of-the-art on the UCF-101 split-1 action recognition dataset by 5.68\% (when trained from scratch) while using only 15\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art.

  abstract = {With the development of the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer model has demonstrated its outstanding performance in the computer vision domain. However, the massive computation brought from the full attention mechanism became a heavy burden for memory consumption. Sequentially, the limitation of memory reduces the possibility of improving the Transformer model. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel memory economy attention mechanism named Couplformer, which decouples the attention map into two sub-matrices and generates the alignment scores from spatial information. A series of different scale image classification tasks are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The result of experiments shows that on the ImageNet-1k classification task, the Couplformer can significantly decrease 28\% memory consumption compared with regular Transformer while accessing sufficient accuracy requirements and outperforming 0.92\% on Top-1 accuracy while occupying the same memory footprint. As a result, the Couplformer can serve as an efficient backbone in visual tasks, and provide a novel perspective on the attention mechanism for researchers.},

  abstract = {Image classification models can depend on multiple different semantic attributes of the image. An explanation of the decision of the classifier needs to both discover and visualize these properties. Here we present StylEx, a method for doing this, by training a generative model to specifically explain multiple attributes that underlie classifier decisions. A natural source for such attributes is the StyleSpace of StyleGAN, which is known to generate semantically meaningful dimensions in the image. However, because standard GAN training is not dependent on the classifier, it may not represent these attributes which are important for the classifier decision, and the dimensions of StyleSpace may represent irrelevant attributes. To overcome this, we propose a training procedure for a StyleGAN, which incorporates the classifier model, in order to learn a classifier-specific StyleSpace. Explanatory attributes are then selected from this space. These can be used to visualize the effect of changing multiple attributes per image, thus providing image-specific explanations. We apply StylEx to multiple domains, including animals, leaves, faces and retinal images. For these, we show how an image can be modified in different ways to change its classifier output. Our results show that the method finds attributes that align well with semantic ones, generate meaningful image-specific explanations, and are human-interpretable as measured in user-studies.},

We evaluate our approach by demonstrating a number of its unique capabilities on convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet. Our evaluation demonstrates that influence-directed explanations (1) identify influential concepts that generalize across instances, (2) can be used to extract the "essence" of what the network learned about a class, and (3) isolate individual features the network uses to make decisions and distinguish related classes.},

In this paper, we propose Attribute Mix, a data augmentation strategy at attribute level to expand the fine-grained samples. The principle lies in that attribute features are shared among fine-grained sub-categories, and can be seamlessly transferred among images. Toward this goal, we propose an automatic attribute mining approach to discover attributes that belong to the same super-category, and Attribute Mix is operated by mixing semantically meaningful attribute features from two images. Attribute Mix is a simple but effective data augmentation strategy that can significantly improve the recognition performance without increasing the inference budgets. Furthermore, since attributes can be shared among images from the same super-category, we further enrich the training samples with attribute level labels using images from the generic domain. Experiments on widely used fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract = {Internet addiction (IA) incurs significant social and financial costs in the form of physical side-effects, academic and occupational impairment, and serious relationship problems. The majority of previous studies on Internet addiction disorders (IAD) have focused on structural and functional abnormalities, while few studies have simultaneously investigated the structural and functional brain alterations underlying individual differences in IA tendencies measured by questionnaires in a healthy sample. Here we combined structural (regional gray matter volume, rGMV) and functional (resting-state functional connectivity, rsFC) information to explore the neural mechanisms underlying IAT in a large sample of 260 healthy young adults. The results showed that IAT scores were significantly and positively correlated with rGMV in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, one key node of the cognitive control network, CCN), which might reflect reduced functioning of inhibitory control. More interestingly, decreased anticorrelations between the right DLPFC and the medial prefrontal cortex/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/rACC, one key node of the default mode network, DMN) were associated with higher IAT scores, which might be associated with reduced efficiency of the CCN and DMN (e.g., diminished cognitive control and self-monitoring). Furthermore, the Stroop interference effect was positively associated with the volume of the DLPFC and with the IA scores, as well as with the connectivity between DLPFC and mPFC, which further indicated that rGMV variations in the DLPFC and decreased anticonnections between the DLPFC and mPFC may reflect addiction-related reduced inhibitory control and cognitive efficiency. These findings suggest the combination of structural and functional information can provide a valuable basis for further understanding of the mechanisms and pathogenesis of IA.},

In this work, we explore an area understudied by previous works -- how the network's architecture impacts its robustness to noisy labels. We provide a formal framework connecting the robustness of a network to the alignments between its architecture and target/noise functions. Our framework measures a network's robustness via the predictive power in its representations -- the test performance of a linear model trained on the learned representations using a small set of clean labels. We hypothesize that a network is more robust to noisy labels if its architecture is more aligned with the target function than the noise. To support our hypothesis, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence across various neural network architectures and different domains. We also find that when the network is well-aligned with the target function, its predictive power in representations could improve upon state-of-the-art (SOTA) noisy-label-training methods in terms of test accuracy and even outperform sophisticated methods that use clean labels.},

The aim of our scoping review was to better understand to what extent and how the AI/ML focused academic literature engaged with the ethics of AI/ML in relation to disabled people. Of the n = 1659 abstracts engaging with AI/ML and ethics downloaded from Scopus (which includes all Medline articles) and the 70 databases of EBSCO ALL, we found 54 relevant abstracts using the term ``patient'' and 11 relevant abstracts mentioning terms linked to ``impair*'', ``disab*'' and ``deaf''.

In this paper, we present a review of these methods on a novel geometric perspective. We categorize these methods by three main groups: Laplacian-based, Hessian-based, and parallel field-based methods. We show the connection and difference between these three groups on their continuous and discrete counterparts.

However standard data augmentation produces only limited plausible alternative data by for example, flipping, distorting, adding noise to, cropping a patch from the original samples. In this paper, we introduce the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to impose the feature representations with uniform distribution and apply the linear interpolation on latent space, which is potential to generate a much broader set of augmentations for image classification. As a possible ``recognition via generation'' framework, it has potentials for several other classification tasks.

  abstract = {Transformers have quickly shined in the computer vision world since the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The dominant role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective transformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional models strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention mechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them, i.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with improved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size continues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin Transformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme convolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be eliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a recipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity, which can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance. Built on this recipe, we propose Sparse Large Kernel Network (SLaK), a pure CNN architecture equipped with sparse factorized 51x51 kernels that can perform on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNet architectures like ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, on ImageNet classification as well as a wide range of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and object detection/segmentation on MS COCO.},

  abstract = {Point cloud analysis is very challenging, as the shape implied in irregular points is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose RS-CNN, namely, Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network, which extends regular grid CNN to irregular configuration for point cloud analysis. The key to RS-CNN is learning from relation, i.e., the geometric topology constraint among points. Specifically, the convolutional weight for local point set is forced to learn a high-level relation expression from predefined geometric priors, between a sampled point from this point set and the others. In this way, an inductive local representation with explicit reasoning about the spatial layout of points can be obtained, which leads to much shape awareness and robustness. With this convolution as a basic operator, RS-CNN, a hierarchical architecture can be developed to achieve contextual shape-aware learning for point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across three tasks verify RS-CNN achieves the state of the arts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \textbackslash textbf\{S\}hifted \textbackslash textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

  abstract = {Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536\$\textbackslash times\$1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.

  abstract = {In a warned reaction time task, the warning stimulus (S1) initiates a process of temporal preparation, which promotes a speeded response to the impending target stimulus (S2). According to the multiple trace theory of temporal preparation (MTP), participants learn the timing of S2 by storing a memory trace on each trial, which contains a temporal profile of the events on that trial. On each new trial, S1 serves as a retrieval cue that implicitly and associatively activates memory traces created on earlier trials, which jointly drive temporal preparation for S2. The idea that S1 assumes this role as a retrieval cue was tested across eight experiments, in which two different S1s were associated with two different distributions of S1-S2 intervals: one with predominantly short and one with predominantly long intervals. Experiments differed regarding the S1 features that made up a pair, ranging from highly distinct (e.g., tone and flash) to more similar (e.g., red and green flash) and verbal (i.e., ``short'' vs ``long''). Exclusively for pairs of highly distinct S1s, the results showed that the S1 cue modified temporal preparation, even in participants who showed no awareness of the contingency. This cueing effect persisted in a subsequent transfer phase, in which the contingency between S1 and the timing of S2 was broken \textendash{} a fact participants were informed of in advance. Together, these findings support the role of S1 as an implicit retrieval cue, consistent with MTP.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

In contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong performance on a variety of non-language tasks1.},

Recent multiview-based methods demonstrate promising performance for 3-D shape recognition and retrieval. However, most multiview-based methods ignore the correlations of multiple views or suffer from high computional cost. In this paper, we propose a novel multiview-based network architecture for 3-D shape recognition and retrieval. Our network combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) to exploit the correlative information from multiple views. Well-pretrained CNNs with residual connections are first used to extract a low-level feature of each view image rendered from a 3-D shape. Then, a LSTM and a sequence voting layer are employed to aggregate these features into a shape descriptor. The highway network and a three-step training strategy are also adopted to boost the optimization of the deep network. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance for 3-D shape recognition and the state-of-the-art performance for the 3-D shape retrieval.},

In particular, popular post-hoc explanation methods such as Integrated Gradients and SmoothGrad tend to align their results with the data manifold. The same is true for the outcome of adversarial training, which has been claimed to lead to more interpretable explanations. Empirically, alignment with the data manifold happens early during training, and to some degree even when training with random labels. However, we theoretically prove that good generalization of neural networks does not imply good or bad alignment of model gradients with the data manifold.

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

As a result, programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target audience, a phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'. This paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate. While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended users. But explainable AI is more likely to succeed if researchers and practitioners understand, adopt, implement, and improve models from the vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, and if evaluation of these models is focused more on people than on technology. From a light scan of literature, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope to infuse more results from the social and behavioural sciences into explainable AI, and present some key results from these fields that are relevant to explainable AI.},

While the conventional method to embed human knowledge has been applied for non-deep machine learning, it is challenging to apply it for deep learning models due to the enormous number of model parameters. To tackle this problem, we focus on the attention mechanism of an attention branch network (ABN). In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning method that utilizes a single-channel attention map which is manually edited by a human expert. Our fine-tuning method can train a network so that the output attention map corresponds to the edited ones. As a result, the fine-tuned network can output an attention map that takes into account human knowledge. Experimental results with ImageNet, CUB-200-2010, and IDRiD demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a clear attention map for a visual explanation and improve the classification performance. Our findings can be a novel framework for optimizing networks through human intuitive editing via a visual interface and suggest new possibilities for human-machine cooperation in addition to the improvement of visual explanations.},

  abstract = {Making decisions in sequentially structured tasks requires integrating distally acquired information. The extensive computational cost of such integration challenges planning methods that integrate online, at decision time. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether ``offline'' integration during replay supports planning, and if so which memories should be replayed. Inspired by machine learning, we propose that (a) offline replay of trajectories facilitates integrating representations that guide decisions, and (b) unsigned prediction errors (uncertainty) trigger such integrative replay. We designed a 2-step revaluation task for fMRI, whereby participants needed to integrate changes in rewards with past knowledge to optimally replan decisions. As predicted, we found that (a) multi-voxel pattern evidence for off-task replay predicts subsequent replanning; (b) neural sensitivity to uncertainty predicts subsequent replay and replanning; (c) off-task hippocampus and anterior cingulate activity increase when revaluation is required. These findings elucidate how the brain leverages offline mechanisms in planning and goaldirected behavior under uncertainty.},

Leveraging such behavior, we perturb questions to craft a variety of adversarial examples. Our strongest attacks drop the accuracy of a visual question answering model from \$61.1\textbackslash\%\$ to \$19\textbackslash\%\$, and that of a tabular question answering model from \$33.5\textbackslash\%\$ to \$3.3\textbackslash\%\$. Additionally, we show how attributions can strengthen attacks proposed by Jia and Liang (2017) on paragraph comprehension models. Our results demonstrate that attributions can augment standard measures of accuracy and empower investigation of model performance.

In certain instances, Instagram acts as a platform for exhibiting photos of risk-taking behavior that the subjects with PIGU upload to gain likes as a surrogate for gaining peer acceptance and popularity.AimsThe primary objective was to evaluate whether addiction-specific cues compared with neutral cues, i.e., negative emotional valence cues vs. positive emotional valence cues, would elicit activation of the dopaminergic reward network (i.e., precuneus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala) and consecutive deactivation of the executive control network [i.e., medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)], in the PIGU subjects.MethodAn fMRI cue-induced reactivity study was performed using negative emotional valence, positive emotional valence, and truly neutral cues, using Instagram themes. Thirty subjects were divided into PIGU and healthy control (HC) groups, based on a set of diagnostic criteria using behavioral tests, including the Modified Instagram Addiction Test (IGAT), to assess the severity of PIGU. In-scanner recordings of the subjects' responses to the images and regional activity of the neural addiction pathways were recorded.ResultsNegative emotional valence {$>$} positive emotional valence cues elicited increased activations in the precuneus in the PIGU group. A negative and moderate correlation was observed between PSC at the right mPFC with the IGAT scores of the PIGU subjects when corrected for multiple comparisons [r = -0.777, (p {$<$} 0.004, two-tailed)].ConclusionAddiction-specific Instagram-themed cues identify the neurobiological underpinnings of Instagram addiction. Activations of the dopaminergic reward system and deactivation of the executive control network indicate converging neuropathological pathways between Instagram addiction and other types of addictions.},

Pictures uploaded onto Instagram by PIGUs have often been associated with risky behaviours in their efforts to gain more `Likes', thus it is hypothesized that PIGUs are more drawn to `Negative-Emotional' cues. To date, there is no local database with addiction-specific cues. Objective: To conduct an out-of-scanner validation study to create a database of pictures using `Negative-Emotional' cues that evoke responses of arousal among PIGUs. Method: Forty-four Malaysian undergraduate students (20 PIGUs, 24 controls) were randomly recruited based on the evaluation using the Smartphone-Addiction-ScaleMalay version (SAS-M) and modified Instagram Addiction Test (IGAT); and fulfilled Lin et al. (2016) definition of addiction. They were administered 200 content-specific pictures that were multidimensional i.e. arousal (excitation/relaxation effects), approach-avoidance (motivational direction) and emotional valence (positive/negative feelings) to describe the PIGUs perception of the psychological properties of the pictures using a 9-point Likert scale. Results: PIGUs viewing `Negative-Emotional' cues demonstrated significant positive correlations between arousal \& valence (z = 4.834, p {$<$} .001, effect size = 0.69) and arousal \& avoidance-approach (z = 4.625, p {$<$} .001, effect size= 0.66) as compared to controls and were more frequently aroused by `NegativeEmotional' type of stimuli. Conclusion: A database of validated, addiction-specific pictures can be developed to potentiate any future cue-induced response to reward fMRI studies to assess PIGU.},

In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained widespread acceptance in a variety of fields, including virtual support, healthcare, and security. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field that has been combining AI and human-computer engagement over the past several years in order to create an interactive intelligent system for user interaction. AI, in conjunction with HCI, is being used in a variety of fields by employing various algorithms and employing HCI to provide transparency to the user, allowing them to trust the machine. The comprehensive examination of both the areas of AI and HCI, as well as their subfields, has been explored in this work. The main goal of this article was to discover a point of intersection between the two fields. The understanding of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which is a linking point of HCI and XAI, was gained through a literature review conducted in this research. The literature survey encompassed themes identified in the literature (such as XAI and its areas, major XAI aims, and XAI problems and challenges). The study's other major focus was on the use of AI, HCI, and XAI in healthcare. The poll also addressed the shortcomings in XAI in healthcare, as well as the field's future potential. As a result, the literature indicates that XAI in healthcare is still a novel subject that has to be explored more in the future.},

Despite ample adaptation of transfer learning in many deep learning applications, we yet do not understand what enables a successful transfer and which part of the network is responsible for that. In this paper, we provide new tools and analysis to address these fundamental questions. Through a series of analysis on transferring to block-shuffled images, we separate the effect of feature reuse from learning high-level statistics of data and show that some benefit of transfer learning comes from the latter. We present that when training from pre-trained weights, the model stays in the same basin in the loss landscape and different instances of such model are similar in feature space and close in parameter space.},

We found that the best threshold value, i.e., the threshold at which we can measure the highest Jaccard index, varies significantly among features; ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. In addition, we measured Jaccard indices as high as 0.143, which is almost 50\% of the performance of state-of-the-art architectures specialized in feature mask prediction at pixel-level, such as U-Net. Finally, a breakdown test between malignancy and classification correctness shows that higher resolution saliency maps could help doctors in spotting wrong classifications.},

We quantify its object classification and object location prediction performance on the Pascal VOC 2012 (20 object classes) and the much larger Microsoft COCO (80 object classes) datasets. We find that the network (i) outputs accurate image-level labels, (ii) predicts approximate locations (but not extents) of objects, and (iii) performs comparably to its fully-supervised counterparts using object bounding box annotation for training.},

  abstract = {Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence generation or transformation problem. Recent work has shown that self-attention is an effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize a recently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood. By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. While conceptually simple, our generative models significantly outperform the current state of the art in image generation on ImageNet, improving the best published negative log-likelihood on ImageNet from 3.83 to 3.77. We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a human evaluation study, we find that images generated by our super-resolution model fool human observers three times more often than the previous state of the art.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are being used increasingly to automate data analysis and decision making, yet their decision-making process is largely unclear and is difficult to explain to the end users. In this paper, we address the problem of Explainable AI for deep neural networks that take images as input and output a class probability. We propose an approach called RISE that generates an importance map indicating how salient each pixel is for the model's prediction. In contrast to white-box approaches that estimate pixel importance using gradients or other internal network state, RISE works on blackbox models. It estimates importance empirically by probing the model with randomly masked versions of the input image and obtaining the corresponding outputs. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art importance extraction methods using both an automatic deletion/insertion metric and a pointing metric based on human-annotated object segments. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our approach matches or exceeds the performance of other methods, including white-box approaches.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies seek to understand the role of oscillatory synchronization in cognition. This problem is particularly challenging in the context of complex cognitive behavior, which consists of a sequence of processing steps with uncertain duration. In this study, we analyzed oscillatory connectivity measures in time windows that previous computational models had associated with a specific sequence of processing steps in an associative memory recognition task (visual encoding, familiarity, memory retrieval, decision making, and motor response). The timing of these processing steps was estimated on a single-trial basis with a novel hidden semi-Markov model multivariate pattern analysis (HSMM-MVPA) method. We show that different processing stages are associated with specific patterns of oscillatory connectivity. Visual encoding is characterized by a dense network connecting frontal, posterior, and temporal areas as well as frontal and occipital phase locking in the 4\textendash 9 Hz theta band. Familiarity is associated with frontal phase locking in the 9\textendash 14 Hz alpha band. Decision making is associated with frontal and temporo-central interhemispheric connections in the alpha band. During decision making, a second network in the theta band that connects left-temporal, central, and occipital areas bears similarity to the neural signature for preparing a motor response. A similar theta band network is also present during the motor response, with additionally alpha band connectivity between righttemporal and posterior areas. This demonstrates that the processing stages discovered with the HSMM-MVPA method are indeed linked to distinct synchronization patterns, leading to a closer understanding of the functional role of oscillations in cognition.},

A popular class of such methods is based on backpropagating a signal and analyzing the resulting gradient. Despite much research on such methods, relatively little work has been done to clarify the differences between such methods as well as the desiderata of these techniques. Thus, there is a need for rigorously understanding the relationships between different methods as well as their failure modes. In this work, we conduct a thorough analysis of backpropagation-based saliency methods and propose a single framework under which several such methods can be unified. As a result of our study, we make three additional contributions. First, we use our framework to propose NormGrad, a novel saliency method based on the spatial contribution of gradients of convolutional weights. Second, we combine saliency maps at different layers to test the ability of saliency methods to extract complementary information at different network levels (e.g. trading off spatial resolution and distinctiveness) and we explain why some methods fail at specific layers (e.g., Grad-CAM anywhere besides the last convolutional layer). Third, we introduce a classsensitivity metric and a meta-learning inspired paradigm applicable to any saliency method for improving sensitivity to the output class being explained.},

Innumerable studies have investigated the perception of time over the last 100 years, but the neural and computational bases for the processing of time remains unknown. Extant models of time perception are discussed before the proposition of a unified model of time perception that relates perceived event timing with perceived duration. The distinction between perceived event timing and perceived duration provides the current for navigating a river of contemporary approaches to time perception. Recent work has advocated a Bayesian approach to time perception. This framework has been applied to both duration and perceived timing, where prior expectations about when a stimulus might occur in the future (prior distribution) are combined with current sensory evidence (likelihood function) in order to generate the perception of temporal properties (posterior distribution). In general, these models predict that the brain uses temporal expectations to bias perception in a way that stimuli are `regularized' i.e. stimuli look more like what has been seen before. As such, the synthesis of perceived timing and duration models is of theoretical importance for the field of timing and time perception.},

Under certain conditions, the gradient of the log-variance loss equals the gradient of the (negative) ELBO.

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

Despite their tremendous success, many such techniques suffer from the ``black-box'' problem, which refers to situations where the data analyst is unable to explain why such techniques arrive at certain decisions. This problem has fuelled interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which refers to techniques that can easily be interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, many of these techniques are not suitable for tabular data, which is surprising given the importance and widespread use of tabular data in critical applications such as finance, healthcare, and criminal justice. Also surprising is the fact that, despite the vast literature on XAI, there are still no survey articles to date that focus on tabular data. Consequently, despite the existing survey articles that cover a wide range of XAI techniques, it remains challenging for researchers working on tabular data to go through all of these surveys and extract the techniques that are suitable for their analysis. Our article fills this gap by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the XAI techniques that are relevant to tabular data. Furthermore, we categorize the references covered in our survey, indicating the type of the model being explained, the approach being used to provide the explanation, and the XAI problem being addressed. Our article is the first to provide researchers with a map that helps them navigate the XAI literature in the context of tabular data.},

The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https: //github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/ along with a demo on CloudCV [2]1 and video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

When considered together, these responsibilities seem staggering -- how does anyone do MLOps, what are the unaddressed challenges, and what are the implications for tool builders? We conducted semi-structured ethnographic interviews with 18 MLEs working across many applications, including chatbots, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Our interviews expose three variables that govern success for a production ML deployment: Velocity, Validation, and Versioning.

Adolescents underwent fMRI while viewing photos ostensibly submitted to Instagram. They were more likely to like photos depicted with many likes than photos with few likes; this finding showed the influence of virtual peer endorsement and held for both neutral photos and photos of risky behaviors (e.g., drinking, smoking). Viewing photos with many (compared with few) likes was associated with greater activity in neural regions implicated in reward processing, social cognition, imitation, and attention. Furthermore, when adolescents viewed risky photos (as opposed to neutral photos), activation in the cognitive-control network decreased. These findings highlight possible mechanisms underlying peer influence during adolescence.},

In recent work, Dhamdhere et al. proposed Total Conductance, a "natural refinement of Integrated Gradients" for attributing importance to internal neurons. Unfortunately, the authors found that calculating conductance in tensorflow required the addition of several custom gradient operators and did not scale well. In this work, we show that the formula for Total Conductance is mathematically equivalent to Path Integrated Gradients computed on a hidden layer in the network. We provide a scalable implementation of Total Conductance using standard tensorflow gradient operators that we call Neuron Integrated Gradients. We compare Neuron Integrated Gradients to DeepLIFT, a pre-existing computationally efficient approach that is applicable to calculating internal neuron importance. We find that DeepLIFT produces strong empirical results and is faster to compute, but because it lacks the theoretical properties of Neuron Integrated Gradients, it may not always be preferred in practice.

Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its 'reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

We assessed brain function in adults with ADHD during simple and complex forms of processing. Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging with forward and backward digit spans to investigate number repetitions and complex working memory function. If pathology is limited to higher cognitive operations, group differences should be confined to the backward condition. Results: During the forward digit span, ADHD participants exhibited greater activation of LH linguistic processing areas and increased activation of right frontal and parietal cortices. During the backward digit span, they exhibited greater activation of LH linguistic processing areas and failed to activate bilateral parietal regions important for the complex executive operations. Conclusion: Abnormal brain function among adult ADHD participants was not limited to complex executive functions. Abnormal processing of numeric stimuli was indicated during both simple and complex cognitive operations. (J. of Att. Dis. 2007;11(2) 125-140)},

The existence of super-convergence is relevant to understanding why deep networks generalize well. One of the key elements of super-convergence is training with one learning rate cycle and a large maximum learning rate. A primary insight that allows super-convergence training is that large learning rates regularize the training, hence requiring a reduction of all other forms of regularization in order to preserve an optimal regularization balance. We also derive a simplification of the Hessian Free optimization method to compute an estimate of the optimal learning rate. Experiments demonstrate super-convergence for Cifar-10/100, MNIST and Imagenet datasets, and resnet, wide-resnet, densenet, and inception architectures. In addition, we show that super-convergence provides a greater boost in performance relative to standard training when the amount of labeled training data is limited. The architectures and code to replicate the figures in this paper are available at github.com/lnsmith54/super-convergence.

We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

We develop a novel method for quantifying biased associations between representations of social concepts and attributes in images. We find that state-of-the-art unsupervised models trained on ImageNet, a popular benchmark image dataset curated from internet images, automatically learn racial, gender, and intersectional biases. We replicate 8 previously documented human biases from social psychology, from the innocuous, as with insects and flowers, to the potentially harmful, as with race and gender. Our results closely match three hypotheses about intersectional bias from social psychology. For the first time in unsupervised computer vision, we also quantify implicit human biases about weight, disabilities, and several ethnicities. When compared with statistical patterns in online image datasets, our findings suggest that machine learning models can automatically learn bias from the way people are stereotypically portrayed on the web.},

When the interval between WS and IS (the foreperiod, FP) is variable, reaction time (RT) is not only influenced by the current FP but also by the FP of the preceding trial. These sequential effects have recently been proposed to originate from a trace conditioning process, in which the individuals learn the temporal WS\textendash IS relationship in a trial-by-trial manner. Research has shown that trace conditioning is maximal when the temporal interval between the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus is between 0.25 and 0.60 s. Consequently, one would predict that sequential effects occur especially within short FP contexts. However, this prediction is contradicted by Karlin [Karlin, L. (1959). Reaction time as a function of foreperiod duration and variability. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 58, 185\textendash 191] who did not observe the typical sequential effects with short FPs. To investigate temporal preparation for short FPs, three experiments were conducted, examining the sequential FP effect comparably for short and long FP-sets (Experiment 1), assessing the influence of catch trials (Experiment 2) and the case of a very dense FP-range (Experiment 3) on sequential FP effects. The results provide strong evidence for sequential effects within a short FP context and thus support the trace conditioning account of temporal preparation.},

In comparison to convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive bias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization or data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training datasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand the interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and compute budget.1 As one result of this study we find that the combination of increased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as models trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models of various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or outperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available JFT-300M dataset.},

Following earlier work that suggested that representations of different time intervals contaminate each other (Grondin, 2005; Jazayeri \& Shadlen, 2010; Jones \& Wearden, 2004), an experiment was conducted in which subjects had to alternate in reproducing two intervals. In two conditions of the experiment, the duration of one of the intervals changed over the experiment, forcing subjects to adjust their representation of that interval, while keeping the other constant. The results show that the adjustment of one interval carried over to the other interval, indicating that subjects were not able to completely separate the two representations. We propose a temporal reference memory that is based on existing memory models (Anderson, 1990). Our model assumes that the representation of an interval is based on a pool of recent experiences. In a series of simulations, we show that our pool model fits the data, while two alternative models that have previously been proposed do not.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice.                                         Methods               Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the ``Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI.                                         Results               Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health.                                         Conclusions               To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.},

Additional representative indicators of impaired control are needed in order to distinguish presumed social media addiction from normal use. Aims: (1) To examine the existence of time distortion during non-social-media use tasks that involve social media cues among those who may be considered at-risk for social media addiction. (2) To examine the usefulness of this distortion for at-risk vs. low/no-risk classification. Method: We used a task that prevented Facebook use and invoked Facebook reflections (survey on self-control strategies) and subsequently measured estimated vs. actual task completion time. We captured the level of addiction using the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale in the survey, and we used a common cutoff criterion to classify people as at-risk vs. low/no-risk of Facebook addiction. Results: The at-risk group presented significant upward time estimate bias and the low/no-risk group presented significant downward time estimate bias. The bias was positively correlated with Facebook addiction scores. It was efficacious, especially when combined with self-reported estimates of extent of Facebook use, in classifying people to the two categories. Conclusions: Our study points to a novel, easy to obtain, and useful marker of at-risk for social media addiction, which may be considered for inclusion in diagnosis tools and procedures.},

Most/Few kids prefer sweets/vegetables . . .) while participants made plausibility judgments (Experiment 1) or read for comprehension (Experiment 2). Control Experiments 3A (plausibility) and 3B (comprehension) removed the discourse contexts. Quantifiers always modulated typical and/or atypical word N400 amplitudes. However, the real-time N400 effects only in Experiment 2 mirrored offline quantifier and typicality crossover interaction effects for plausibility ratings and cloze probabilities. We conclude that quantifier expressions can be interpreted fully and immediately, though pragmatic and task variables appear to impact the speed and/or depth of quantifier interpretation.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

A comprehensive thematic survey on medical image segmentation using deep learning techniques is presented. This paper makes two original contributions. Firstly, compared to traditional surveys that directly divide literatures of deep learning on medical image segmentation into many groups and introduce literatures in detail for each group, we classify currently popular literatures according to a multi-level structure from coarse to fine. Secondly, this paper focuses on supervised and weakly supervised learning approaches, without including unsupervised approaches since they have been introduced in many old surveys and they are not popular currently. For supervised learning approaches, we analyse literatures in three aspects: the selection of backbone networks, the design of network blocks, and the improvement of loss functions. For weakly supervised learning approaches, we investigate literature according to data augmentation, transfer learning, and interactive segmentation, separately. Compared to existing surveys, this survey classifies the literatures very differently from before and is more convenient for readers to understand the relevant rationale and will guide them to think of appropriate improvements in medical image segmentation based on deep learning approaches.},

We demonstrate that Score-CAM achieves better visual performance and fairness for interpreting the decision making process.

This dissociation between conscious perception and sensory stimulation has motivated various empirical studies on the neural correlates of bistable perception, but the neurocomputational mechanism behind endogenous perceptual transitions has remained elusive. Here, we recurred to a generic Bayesian framework of predictive coding and devised a model that casts endogenous perceptual transitions as a consequence of prediction errors emerging from residual evidence for the suppressed percept. Data simulations revealed close similarities between the model's predictions and key temporal characteristics of perceptual bistability, indicating that the model was able to reproduce bistable perception. Fitting the predictive coding model to behavioural data from an fMRI-experiment on bistable perception, we found a correlation across participants between the model parameter encoding perceptual stabilization and the behaviourally measured frequency of perceptual transitions, corroborating that the model successfully accounted for participants' perception. Formal model comparison with established models of bistable perception based on mutual inhibition and adaptation, noise or a combination of adaptation and noise was used for the validation of the predictive coding model against the established models. Most importantly, model-based analyses of the fMRI data revealed that prediction error timecourses derived from the predictive coding model correlated with neural signal time-courses in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and anterior insulae. Voxel-wise model selection indicated a superiority of the predictive coding model over conventional analysis approaches in explaining neural activity in these frontal areas, suggesting that frontal cortex encodes prediction errors that mediate endogenous perceptual transitions in bistable perception. Taken together, our current work provides a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of behavioural and neural data using a predictive coding perspective on bistable perception. In this, our approach posits a crucial role of prediction error signalling for the resolution of perceptual ambiguities.},

  abstract = {Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a series of computer vision tasks, yet they still suffer from adversarial examples. \% crafted in a similar fashion as CNNs. In this paper, we posit that adversarial attacks on transformers should be specially tailored for their architecture, jointly considering both patches and self-attention, in order to achieve high transferability. More specifically, we introduce a dual attack framework, which contains a Pay No Attention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut attack, to improve the transferability of adversarial samples across different ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients of attention during backpropagation can generate adversarial examples with high transferability. In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing randomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack success rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability of attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can greatly boost transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs. In addition, the proposed method can easily be combined with existing transfer methods to boost performance. Code is available at https://github.com/zhipeng-wei/PNA-PatchOut.},

  abstract = {Transfer learning is important for foundation models to adapt to downstream tasks. However, many foundation models are proprietary, so users must share their data with model owners to fine-tune the models, which is costly and raise privacy concerns. Moreover, fine-tuning large foundation models is computation-intensive and impractical for most downstream users. In this paper, we propose Offsite-Tuning, a privacy-preserving and efficient transfer learning framework that can adapt billion-parameter foundation models to downstream data without access to the full model. In offsite-tuning, the model owner sends a light-weight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator to the data owner, who then fine-tunes the adapter on the downstream data with the emulator's assistance. The fine-tuned adapter is then returned to the model owner, who plugs it into the full model to create an adapted foundation model. Offsite-tuning preserves both parties' privacy and is computationally more efficient than the existing fine-tuning methods that require access to the full model weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of offsite-tuning on various large language and vision foundation models. Offsite-tuning can achieve comparable accuracy as full model fine-tuning while being privacy-preserving and efficient, achieving 6.5x speedup and 5.6x memory reduction.

Many multi-view-based methods are proposed to improve the category recognition accuracy. These approaches mainly rely on multi-view images that are rendered with the whole circumference. In real-world applications, however, 3D objects are mostly observed from partial viewpoints in a less range. Therefore, we propose a multi-view-based 3D convolutional neural network that takes only part of contiguous multi-view images as input and can still maintain high accuracy. Moreover, our model takes these view images as a joint variable to better learn the spatially correlated features using 3D convolution and 3D max-pooling layers. The experimental results on ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 datasets show that our MV-C3D technique can achieve outstanding performance with multi-view images that are captured from partial angles with less range. The results on 3D-rotated real image dataset MIRO further demonstrate that MV-C3D is more adaptable in real-world scenarios. The classification accuracy can be further improved with the increasing number of view images.},

While a variety of methods have been proposed to robustify neural networks, these techniques often target models trained on ImageNet classification. At the same time, it is a common practice to use ImageNet pretrained backbones for downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification from different domains. This raises a question: Can these robust image classifiers transfer robustness to downstream tasks? For object detection and semantic segmentation, we find that a vanilla Swin Transformer, a variant of Vision Transformer tailored for dense prediction tasks, transfers robustness better than Convolutional Neural Networks that are trained to be robust to the corrupted version of ImageNet. For CIFAR10 classification, we find that models that are robustified for ImageNet do not retain robustness when fully fine-tuned. These findings suggest that current robustification techniques tend to emphasize ImageNet evaluations. Moreover, network architecture is a strong source of robustness when we consider transfer learning.},

In this paper, we examine ImageNet, a large-scale ontology of images that has spurred the development of many modern computer vision methods. We consider three key factors within the person subtree of ImageNet that may lead to problematic behavior in downstream computer vision technology: (1) the stagnant concept vocabulary of WordNet, (2) the attempt at exhaustive illustration of all categories with images, and (3) the inequality of representation in the images within concepts. We seek to illuminate the root causes of these concerns and take the first steps to mitigate them constructively.},

However, some studies have found that the neural network usually has texture bias effect, which means that the neural network is more sensitive to the texture information than the shape information. Based on such phenomenon, we propose a new way to improve network performance by making full use of gradient information. The dual features network (DuFeNet) is proposed in this paper. In DuFeNet, one sub-network is used to learn the information of gradient features, and the other is a traditional neural network with texture bias. The structure of DuFeNet is easy to implement in the original neural network structure. The experimental results clearly show that DuFeNet can achieve better accuracy in image classification and detection. It can increase the shape bias of the network adapted to human visual perception. Besides, DuFeNet can be used without modifying the structure of the original network at lower additional parameters cost.},

By varying the perturbation distribution that defines infidelity, we obtain novel explanations by optimizing infidelity, which we show to out-perform existing explanations in both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Another salient question given these measures is how to modify any given explanation to have better values with respect to these measures. We propose a simple modification based on lowering sensitivity, and moreover show that when done appropriately, we could simultaneously improve both sensitivity as well as fidelity.},

Recent efforts to reduce these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers while at the same time aiming to not sacrifice performance. In this paper, we propose a novel criterion for CNN pruning inspired by neural network interpretability: The most relevant units, i.e. weights or filters, are automatically found using their relevance scores obtained from concepts of explainable AI (XAI). By exploring this idea, we connect the lines of interpretability and model compression research. We show that our proposed method can efficiently prune CNN models in transfer-learning setups in which networks pre-trained on large corpora are adapted to specialized tasks. The method is evaluated on a broad range of computer vision datasets. Notably, our novel criterion is not only competitive or better compared to state-of-the-art pruning criteria when successive retraining is performed, but clearly outperforms these previous criteria in the resource-constrained application scenario in which the data of the task to be transferred to is very scarce and one chooses to refrain from fine-tuning. Our method is able to compress the model iteratively while maintaining or even improving accuracy. At the same time, it has a computational cost in the order of gradient computation and is comparatively simple to apply without the need for tuning hyperparameters for pruning.},

They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout remove informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gains in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of-distribution detection performances.

However, these become distorted and misleading when explaining predictions of images that are subject to systematic error (bias) by perturbations and corruptions. Furthermore, the distortions persist despite model fine-tuning on images biased by different factors (blur, color temperature, day/night). We present Debiased-CAM to recover explanation faithfulness across various bias types and levels by training a multi-input, multi-task model with auxiliary tasks for explanation and bias level predictions. In simulation studies, the approach not only enhanced prediction accuracy, but also generated highly faithful explanations about these predictions as if the images were unbiased. In user studies, debiased explanations improved user task performance, perceived truthfulness and perceived helpfulness. Debiased training can provide a versatile platform for robust performance and explanation faithfulness for a wide range of applications with data biases.},

We aim to discover representation flaws caused by potential dataset bias. More specifically, when the CNN is trained to estimate image attributes, we mine latent relationships between representations of different attributes inside the CNN. Then, we compare the mined attribute relationships with ground-truth attribute relationships to discover the CNN's blind spots and failure modes due to dataset bias. In fact, representation flaws caused by dataset bias cannot be examined by conventional evaluation strategies based on testing images, because testing images may also have a similar bias. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

This simple technique has shown to substantially improve both the model's robustness as well as the generalization of the trained model. However, it is not well-understood why such improvement occurs. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate how using Mixup in training helps model robustness and generalization. For robustness, we show that minimizing the Mixup loss corresponds to approximately minimizing an upper bound of the adversarial loss. This explains why models obtained by Mixup training exhibits robustness to several kinds of adversarial attacks such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). For generalization, we prove that Mixup augmentation corresponds to a specific type of data-adaptive regularization which reduces overfitting. Our analysis provides new insights and a framework to understand Mixup.},

  abstract = {The wide 3D applications have led to increasing amount of 3D object data, and thus effective 3D object classification technique has become urgent requirement. One important and challenging task for 3D object classification is how to formulate the 3D data correlation and exploit it. Most of previous works focus on learning optimal pairwise distance metric for object comparison, which may lose the global correlation among 3D objects. Recently, transductive hypergraph learning has been investigated for classification, which can jointly explore the correlation among multiple objects, including both the labeled and unlabeled data. Although these methods have shown better performance, they are still limited due to 1) a considerable amount of testing data may not be available in practice and 2) the high computational cost to test new coming data. To handle this problem, considering the multimodal representations of 3D objects in practice, we propose an inductive multi-hypergraph learning algorithm, which targets on learning an optimal projection for the multi-modal training data. In this method, all the training data are formulated in multihypergraph based on the features, and the inductive learning is conducted to learn the projection matrices and the optimal multi-hypergraph combination weights simultaneously. Different from the transductive learning on hypergraph, the high cost training process is off-line, and the testing process is very efficient for the inductive learning on hypergraph. We have conducted experiments on two 3D benchmarks, i.e., the NTU and the ModelNet40 datasets, and compared the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods and traditional transductive multi-hypergraph learning methods. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve effective and efficient classification performance. We also note that the proposed method is a general framework and has the potential to be applied in other applications in practice.},

However, the point cloud is sparse, unstructured, and unordered, which cannot be recognized accurately by a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) nor a recurrent neural network (RNN). Fortunately, a graph convolutional neural network (Graph CNN) can process sparse and unordered data. Hence, we propose a linked dynamic graph CNN (LDGCNN) to classify and segment point cloud directly in this paper. We remove the transformation network, link hierarchical features from dynamic graphs, freeze feature extractor, and retrain the classifier to increase the performance of LDGCNN. We explain our network using theoretical analysis and visualization. Through experiments, we show that the proposed LDGCNN achieves state-of-art performance on two standard datasets: ModelNet40 and ShapeNet.},

The present study investigated participants' propensity to repost microblog messages of positive, negative, or neutral valence, and studied the neural correlates during resting state with the reposting rate of each type microblog messages. Participants preferred to repost negative messages relative to positive and neutral messages. Reposting rate of negative messages was positively correlated to the functional connectivity of temporoparietal junction (TPJ) with insula, and TPJ with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that reposting negative messages is related to conflict resolution between the feeling of pain/disgust and the intention to repost significant information. Thus, resposting emotional microblog messages might be attributed to participants' appraisal of personal and recipient's interest, as well as their cognitive process for decision making.},

Moreover, interpretability is a desired property for deep networks to become powerful tools in other research fields, e.g., drug discovery and genomics. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the neural network interpretability research. We first clarify the definition of interpretability as it has been used in many different contexts. Then we elaborate on the importance of interpretability and propose a novel taxonomy organized along three dimensions: type of engagement (passive vs. active interpretation approaches), the type of explanation, and the focus (from local to global interpretability). This taxonomy provides a meaningful 3D view of distribution of papers from the relevant literature as two of the dimensions are not simply categorical but allow ordinal subcategories. Finally, we summarize the existing interpretability evaluation methods and suggest possible research directions inspired by our new taxonomy.},

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) provides more information to help users to understand model decisions, yet this additional knowledge exposes additional risks for privacy attacks. Hence, providing explanation harms privacy. We study this risk for image-based model inversion attacks and identified several attack architectures with increasing performance to reconstruct private image data from model explanations. We have developed several multi-modal transposed CNN architectures that achieve significantly higher inversion performance than using the target model prediction only. These XAI-aware inversion models were designed to exploit the spatial knowledge in image explanations. To understand which explanations have higher privacy risk, we analyzed how various explanation types and factors influence inversion performance. In spite of some models not providing explanations, we further demonstrate increased inversion performance even for nonexplainable target models by exploiting explanations of surrogate models through attention transfer. This method first inverts an explanation from the target prediction, then reconstructs the target image. These threats highlight the urgent and significant privacy risks of explanations and calls attention for new privacy preservation techniques that balance the dual-requirement for AI explainability and privacy.},

Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.

  abstract = {Vision transformers have attracted much attention from computer vision researchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of ConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much progress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned representations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets' features. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer learning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and multi-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the performance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual ConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones (i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that indicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets. We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13 downstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained classification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth estimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More specifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network fine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have such a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in multi-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually beneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant tasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation of vision transformers in the future.},

Generally, it is assumed that AI can enable machines to exhibit human-like intelligence, and is claimed to benefit to different areas of our lives. Since AI is fueled by data and is a distinct form of autonomous and self-learning agency, we are seeing increasing ethical concerns related to AI uses. In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner. Similar to ethical framework used in biomedical and clinical research, this paper suggests checklist-style questionnaires as benchmarks for the implementation of ethical principles of AI.},

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners.

Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey paper reviews more than forty representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over twenty representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different datasets, i.e., Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31. And the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},
