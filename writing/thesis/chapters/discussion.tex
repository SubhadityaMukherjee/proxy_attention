\section{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is it possible to create an augmentation technique that uses Attention maps?
    \item Is it possible to approximate the effects of Attention from ViTs in a CNN without changing the architecture?
    \item Is it possible to make a network converge faster and consequently require less data using the outputs from XAI techniques?
    \item Does using Proxy Attention impact the explainability positively?
\end{enumerate}

\section{General Discussion}
- optimizations , memory leaks
- managing computational resources and multiple experiments
- Improvements with better XAI techniques, better CNNs
