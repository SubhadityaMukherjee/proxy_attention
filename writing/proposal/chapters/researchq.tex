\section{Research Questions} \label{section:researchq}
The main research questions that summarize the aims of this study are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is it possible to create an augmentation technique based on Attention maps?
    \item Is it possible to approximate the effects of Attention from ViTs in a CNN?
    \item Is it possible to make a network converge faster and consequently require less data using the outputs from XAI techniques?
    \item Does Proxy Attention impact the explainability of the model in turn?
\end{itemize}
